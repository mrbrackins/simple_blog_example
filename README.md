# Express + MongoDB Blog Example

This is a simple blog application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It includes basic functionality to create and fetch posts, and serves as an example for teaching students how to work with these technologies.

## Features

- Basic Express.js server with EJS templating.
- Routes to create and retrieve posts using MongoDB.
- Form handling for adding new posts.
- Basic error handling and database connection setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (or a MongoDB service like Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-mongo-blog.git
   cd express-mongo-blog
   ```
````

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following content:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://yourMongoDBConnectionStringHere
   ```

   Replace `yourMongoDBConnectionStringHere` with the actual connection string from your local MongoDB instance or MongoDB Atlas.

4. Run the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Your server will start on port `3000`.

### Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the following routes:

- **GET /**: Displays a welcome message.
- **GET /posts**: Renders the main page with all posts.
- **GET /post/:id**: Fetches a specific post by its ID in JSON format.
- **GET /api/getPosts**: Returns all posts from the database in JSON format.
- **POST /api/newPost**: Adds a new post. You need to send a JSON body with the fields `postName`, `postContent`, and `postNumber`.

### Example API Request for New Post

```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/api/newPost
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "postName": "My First Post",
  "postContent": "This is the content of my first post.",
  "postNumber": 1
}
```

### Example API Request for Fetching Posts

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/getPosts
```

### Example API Request for Fetching a Specific Post

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/post/60c72b8f4f1c2b00d4d0c5eb
```

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to build the server.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store posts.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Document Mapping) library for MongoDB to interact with the database.
- **EJS**: Templating engine to render views.

## Notes

- The app is built to run on a local machine or a cloud instance with MongoDB.
- You can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test API endpoints.
- The code is intentionally left unrefactored for educational purposes.
